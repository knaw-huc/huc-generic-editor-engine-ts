# HuC-generic-editor-engine-ts

TypeScript engine/editor for structured data

## Prerequisites

* Docker is up and running


##  Docker & TypeScript version

From the README.md directory:

 ```docker-compose up -d```

A lightweight PHP server is started for serving the json-configuration files. 

Visit http://localhost:8888/  in your browser. 
You see a structured form, on-the-fly generated by TypeScript

* On http://localhost:8888/ the TypeScript/JavaScript version
* On http://localhost:8888/server.php the json-configuration file for the form. Served by the PHP server 


A lightweight PHP server is started for serving the json-configuration files. 
You can edit the configuration file in:
```webroot/json_examples/devdata.json```
 

## Without Docker and Node

You can still see what it looks like:

Open  ```webroot/standalone_original/index.html``` in your favourite browser.
The json configuration is embedded in a JS object literal.


## TS Development with Visual Studio Code

### Prerequisites
* node.js is installed
* TypeScript is installed
* a *nix based system

Only once:
- install Extension: Live Server (only once)

Each time:
- ```docker-compose up -d``` , you'll need the php server to load/serve the configuration files
- from the Menu in Visual Studio Code: Terminal => Run Build Task...  select tsc: Watch
- select webroot/index.html in editor
- start LiveServer (click on GoLive), you'll be redirected to: http://127.0.0.1:5500/webroot/index.html
- every save in webroot/src/ccfparser.ts will be compiled to ccfparser.js in the same directory
- AND the LiveServer will refresh the page
